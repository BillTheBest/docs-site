configs
=======
A simple configuration file that maps to product types and sub-directories in the web site::

  cdap.txt
  coopr.txt
  tigon.txt
  
Instructions for configuring the file are in each file.


www
===
Top-level directory, to be mapped to the web server.

This is intended for Amazon S3.

These directories are to be excluded from syncing::

  www/cdap/current
  www/coopr/current
  www/tigon/current

as they are copies used to test the menus when the configuration file has been generated.

The build script (see below) copies the contents of ``www`` to the ``target`` directory when
it is run.

scripts
=======
Script used to create the JSON, timeline, and current version from the configuration files
for these files::

  target/cdap/json-versions.js
  target/cdap/version
  target/coopr/json-versions.js
  target/coopr/version
  target/tigon/json-versions.js
  target/tigon/version

Run ``build.sh`` to generate the JSON (for menu and timeline), and update the version
file for a specific type, such as::

  $ ./build.sh cdap
  
To generate all JSONs and version files, and copy supporting files, use::

  $ ./build.sh
  
You can then open index files (such as ``target/cdap/index.html`` and ``target/cdap/current/index.html``)
and check the generated timelines and drop-down version menus.

The Python script (``builder.py``) is called by ``build.sh`` and actually generates the timeline and version files.
