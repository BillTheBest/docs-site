configs
=======
A simple configuration file that maps to product types and sub-directories in the web site::

  cdap.txt
  coopr.txt
  tigon.txt
  
Instructions for configuring the file are in each file.


www
===
Top-level directory, to be mapped to the web server.

This is intended for Amazon S3.

Exclude these directories from syncing::

  www/cdap/current
  www/coopr/current
  www/tigon/current

as they are copies used to test the menus when the configuration file has been generated.


scripts
=======
Script used to create the JSON and timeline from the configuration files (conf.txt) in these directories::

  www/cdap/json-versions.js
  www/coopr/json-versions.js
  www/tigon/json-versions.js

Run ``build.sh`` to generate the JSON (for menu and timeline), and update the version file, such as::

  $ ./build.sh build-json cdap
  
To generate all JSONs and version files, use::

  $ ./build.sh build-jsons-all
